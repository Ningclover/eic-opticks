# ============================
# End-to-end test: GPU vs G4 wavelength shifting physics
#
# Emits UV photons (350nm) from inside a WLS sphere and compares
# GPU (opticks) and G4 hit wavelength distributions, WLS conversion
# rate, and arrival-time distributions using KS tests.
#
# Geometry: tests/geom/wls_test.gdml (introduced in #269)
#   - WLS sphere r=20mm (absorbs UV, re-emits visible)
#   - Detector shell r=28-30mm (100% efficiency)
#   - Air outside the sphere
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/test_wavelength_shifting.sh [seed]
#
# Exit code 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL
#
